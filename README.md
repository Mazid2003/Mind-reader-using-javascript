# Mind Reader 🧠🔮

**Project Overview**

The Mind Reader is a fun, interactive web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It creates the illusion of reading the user's mind by "predicting" a number they enter. The project features a stylish animated background, dynamic loading messages, and floating particles for a magical effect.

**Features**

✅ Interactive UI – User-friendly interface with animations and effects

✅ Fake Mind Reading Effect – Simulated AI prediction using timed messages

✅ Loading Animation – Step-by-step scanning messages for realism

✅ Floating Particles – Dynamic animated effects for an engaging experience

✅ Responsive Design – Works on desktops and mobile devices

**How It Works**

1️⃣ The user thinks of a number between 1 and 100 and enters it in the input box.

2️⃣ When they click the "Reveal My Thought" button, a fake scanning animation starts.

3️⃣ A series of loading messages appear to simulate "mind reading."

4️⃣ After a few seconds, the app reveals the exact number the user entered, creating the illusion of mind reading.

**Technology Stack**

🛠 HTML – Structure of the web page

🎨 CSS – Styling, background animations, and floating particles

⚡ JavaScript – Game logic, animations, and dynamic interactions

**Code Breakdown**

1️⃣ Background Animation

A gradient animation creates a smooth color-changing effect in the background.

2️⃣ Floating Particles

Randomly generated floating particles add a magical touch.

These are created dynamically using JavaScript and animated with CSS keyframes.

3️⃣ Loading Messages & Mind Reading Effect

When the user enters a number and clicks the button:

A series of scanning messages appear, changing every second.

After a few seconds, the app "predicts" the number the user entered.

**Future Enhancements**

🚀 Add speech synthesis to make the app talk while reading the mind.

🎭 Use AI models to predict a random number instead of just revealing the input.

📱 Improve mobile responsiveness and add touch gestures.
